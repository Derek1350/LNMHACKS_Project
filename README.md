## Known Issues

While the majority of the project is complete, we want to be transparent about a challenge we faced during development. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen technical constraints, we were unable to seamlessly integrate the songs directly into the frontend of the application.

### Issue Details

The initial goal was to provide users with a seamless experience of playing the suggested songs directly on the Moodify website. However, due to complexities in handling music playback and ensuring a smooth user experience, we had to defer this functionality.

### Workaround

To listen to the curated playlists, users can easily access and play the suggested songs on Spotify. Clicking on a song will redirect users to the corresponding track on Spotify, where they can enjoy the music without any interruptions.
